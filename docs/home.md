## How to use the documentation
This documentation is divided by role. Check your role-specific tab for guidelines. For example, if you are artist, go to artist tab to check which guidelines apply to you. 

There are also shared guidelines, for example rules for using version control. Those you can find in the "Code of Conduct" Section.
