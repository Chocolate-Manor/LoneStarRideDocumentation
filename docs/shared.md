## Our goals:
To achieve the most player satisfaction while being financially viable!
## Recipe of the Manor:
### **Initiative**: "I Intend To ..."
Initiative means No top-down leadership, means we take action without direction from above. DECISIONS are made by those doing the work. You can take OWNERSHIP. Show your work proudly and keep everyone informed. With each resident of the manor taking initiative, the leverage is immense.

### **Innovate**: "Let's try this, ..."

- "**I** believe this small change could help us move smoother..."

- "**I** want to be honest about this..."  
- "**I** understand, and here’s the reality of the situation..."  
- "**I** think we need to talk about what’s _actually_ going on..."
